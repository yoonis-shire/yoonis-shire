Hello, my name is Yoonis Shire I am full stack software developer having experience in React, JS, HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL. My Repositories include mission assignments I've completed as part of the Mission Ready Advanced Full Stack Developer Accelerator program and my most recent personal project a JD checkout bot capable of selecting a product and fulfilling purchase, to showcase my understanding of HTML structure and automation of repetitive tasks to speed up the checkout process.

My interests outside of technology are playing basketball and soccer as well as mixed martial arts and, in my downtime, enjoy playing campaign and multiplayer video games, currently doing a Dark Souls Marathon.
